# Contacts
This repo contains code for importing contacts in your phone from telegram 

During a relaxing sunday evening I open WhatsApp and I discovered that all my contacts were deleted.
I tried to recover them from my Google account but nothing, probably I was out of sync. Luckily telegram had stored my contacts information. 

In this repo I try to explain how to recover your contacts from Telegram and import them in your phone, I hope it can be useful to someone.
